HEADER:
- menu items: =======================> OK 
    - grid?
    - "View all job by..."
- input search: the text color of placeholder is not right =======================> OK (set opacity = 1 for ::placeholder)

COMPANY OVERVIEW (1/ bottom of job overview, 2/ top of company profile, 3/ right side of job page):
- reuse? =======================> OK 

CHARACTERISTICITEM:
- get icons from official website?

JOBLIST:
- scroll behavior to bottom =======================> OK (set height to fit the screen)
- 1st click to jobItem (affected by a callback which is setState (useState) in useEffect): component re-render 2 times?

JOBITEM:
- job-title: margin-bottom does not work =======================> OK (set display block/flex)
- using reload when switching among jobs

PAGINATION:
- optimize logic?

GLOBALSTORE:
- structure for multiple state?
- jobList vs recommendedJobList
- use memo to avoid components re-render when state changes: does not work with headerShrink
- state: currentCity vs searchLocation; userInputText vs searchText; setSearchJobList(jobList) in MenuSubItem

FILTERJOBS:
- optimize logic?
- setSearchText in Search components

APIS:
- call apis one or many times? reset data when switching among pages
- url structure, how to remove multiple special characters from a string
- job api
- redirect to 404 page when url is not correct/ private pages for user only
- fetch api for userList will overwrite old data and it will not be persisted with Redux persist

REDUX:
- blacklist, whitelist: how to apply for children of an obj 
- usersSlice- updateUser: only update data for currentUser does not update the state in store
- jobList title display on loading

COMMON: 
- data structure's rules?
- check the existence before processing data (data is undefined before calling apis causes error: "Cannot read properties of undefined ")
- components' separation is reasonable?
- tippyjs: hideOnClick does not work
- how to reuse a function (ex: handleSearchJobs)?
- window.location.reload(false)
- transition for elements have display none (Modal)
- apply useCallback for funcs have params
